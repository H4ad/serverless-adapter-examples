See above how to develop for Azure Functions.

## Development

> We recommend you to use vscode extension to develop with azure, [see more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node)

First, install the libraries with:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, to test locally, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To test like Azure Function, you can run:

```bash
npm run start:azure
